# text-search-engine
A text engine with a self-hosted server

## code breakdown
What I did to break it down

## templates
Every html I did (front-end is a nightmare)

## ver1
Primitive Google search engine, has duplicate entries.

## ver2
Doesn't work now, weirdly

## ver3
Table-formatted directory to display all text with pagination (doesn't preserve format).
